# Experiment Plan

## Phase 0: Trace Schema Validation

- Unit-test lifecycle event ordering, missing stages, and bottleneck
  attribution rules.
- Generate synthetic traces for known tokenizer delay, queueing, prefill,
  decode, KV pressure, streaming backpressure, and cleanup bottlenecks.
- Report attribution accuracy, false positives, false negatives, complete span
  coverage, and missing-event rate. Trace overhead is out of scope for this
  phase because no serving runtime is launched.

Evidence label: `simulation/model`.

Latest valid no-NPU result:
`.benchmarks/results/synthetic_fault_injection_env/`, generated in
`vllm-request-lifecycle-profiler-exp`, reports 7/7 correct synthetic
attributions, zero false positives, zero false negatives, and zero missing-event
rate across all deterministic fault cases. This supports schema/harness
coverage only; it does not support live NPU6 diagnosis or speedup claims.

## Phase 1: Existing-Server Probe on NPU6

- Follow `docs/npu6_trace_probe_runbook.md` before probing any server.
- Instrument baseline serving without changing runtime behavior.
- Run shared workloads and emit per-request timelines.
- Compare profiler reports against raw logs and simple stage timers.

Evidence label: `existing-server-probe`.

Latest attempt:
`.benchmarks/results/npu6_existing_server_probe_blocked/` records that NPU6 was
visible with no `npu-smi` process owner, but no project-defined existing-server
endpoint, model identity, request client, or trace export hook was available.
This is a blocked/invalid probe directory and must not support paper claims.

Readiness preflight:
`.benchmarks/preflight_npu6_trace_probe.py` now defines the repo-local
read-only preflight. It verifies endpoint authentication, `/v1/models`, model
path, Ascend runtime root, NPU6 process ownership, trace export schema, and the
pinned workload submodule commit. If a runtime trace hook is missing, the
preflight records the missing hook as `trace_export_invalid:*` rather than
claiming an online measurement.

## Phase 2: Controlled Fault Injection

- Inject tokenizer slow path, queue surge, long-prompt prefill, decode-heavy
  output, KV pressure boundary, slow streaming client, and cleanup stall
  conditions.
- Measure whether attribution matches injected ground truth.

Evidence label: `real-online` only when the runtime actually serves requests on
NPU6; otherwise use `replay` or `simulation/model`.

## Required Artifact Fields

Every run directory must include `run_metadata.json` with parent commit,
environment, NPU id, model, runtime, workload source, injected fault, command,
dirty state, and evidence label.
