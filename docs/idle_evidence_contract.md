# Idle Evidence Contract (M0)

Status: Draft v4.2 (proposed for M0 approval)

Target: cross-layer device idle-gap and synchronization evidence, as defined in
intellistream/vllm-request-lifecycle-profiler-plugin#2 (M0) and
vLLM-HUST/vllm-hust-perf-analyzer#3 (engineering).

Related design: `notes/rfc-synchronization-gap-attribution.md` (v2 draft).

v4 changes from v3: candidate concept generalized (possible-overlap and
non-robust-delay are candidates too, with `candidate_status`); `record`
folded into `runtime_control_present` and `unknown` handling made explicit;
`host_sync_api_present` requirement unified and cross-domain projection
clarified; Theil-Sen fit fully frozen (marker host time, formulas, median
rule, fit/holdout stratification); epsilon unit-corrected; unified evidence
link table; communication canonicalization conditions; frozen
`analysis_status`; version columns split; RFC 8785 JCS run_id; FAR precision
definition.

v4.1 changes from v4: `host_sync_api_present` now requires robust temporal
overlap after calibrated mapping; `exact_connection_id` is supporting
evidence only and can never replace robust overlap. Clock-model error fields
unified to `absolute_residual_*`.

v4.2 changes from v4.1: analysis span and stream universe defined per logical
`(run_id, device_id)` after split-shard merge; fit/holdout calibration
requires a non-empty validation set (else `alignment_status = invalid`);
host-sync emitted slice = robust interval ∩ remaining gap; versioned, hashed
host-API allowlist ruleset; fixed `scale` serialization and deterministic
timestamp rounding; interval conventions scoped to interval-bearing tables;
`synthetic_only` permitted for correlation-mechanism validation on controlled
fixtures; zero-gap coverage shares defined as `NA`; run-level metadata record
carries `analysis_status` and nullable span boundaries.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This contract freezes the evidence vocabulary, classification rules, and
attribution discipline for device idle-gap and synchronization-wait analysis.
It answers the question that reviewers will ask first:

> Is the reported idle gap a real wait, or an artifact of cross-clock,
> sampling, or missing events?

The contract binds two parties:

- **Producers** (research, analyzer, attribution rules): output only the
  categories, evidence levels, and relations defined here.
- **Consumers** (engineering implementation, downstream users, reviewers):
  interpret every number through the category x evidence-level matrix.

Out of scope: anomaly search strategy, end-to-end causal models, and
performance fixes (per parent issue #2 boundary). This contract produces
conservative cross-layer **localization** evidence only.

## 2. Normative Terminology

- `analysis span`: the analyzed time range of one logical `(run_id,
  device_id)` pair, constructed AFTER all split profile shards for that
  device are imported and merged. Database identity is retained for lineage
  only; per-shard spans are never used (they would silently omit gaps at
  shard boundaries and break monolithic/split equivalence). Default:
  `[first productive task start, last productive task end)`, or an
  explicitly configured anchor-scoped range. Gaps are defined only inside the
  analysis span.
- `interval`: a half-open integer-nanosecond range `[start_ns, end_ns)` with
  `end_ns > start_ns`, in one `clock_domain`.
- `productive timeline`: the interval union of productive task intervals
  (taxonomy in section 4).
- `gap`: a maximal connected interval in `complement(productive timeline)
  ∩ analysis span`.
- `stream universe`: for one logical `(run_id, device_id)` after shard
  merge, the set of streams that have at least one profiler-visible event
  inside the analysis span. This is an **observed universe**, not the set of
  all runtime streams.
- `collection status`: completeness attestation of the input capture
  (`complete` / `incomplete` / `unknown` / `invalid`), from external or
  collection-side evidence. Not derivable from the trace content alone.
- `link status`: join resolution of a host/device `connectionId` link
  (`unique` / `one_to_many` / `ambiguous` / `unresolved`).
- `analysis status`: frozen per-run enum: `ok` | `no_productive_span` |
  `invalid_analysis_span` | `empty_input` | `invalid_input`.
- `candidate`: a diagnostic-only hypothesis or below-threshold association
  that does not enter the official explanation partition. A candidate may
  carry `correlated` or `inferred` evidence, but never contributes to
  official coverage (sections 6.5, 11).
- `evidence level`: how strongly the evidence supports the category claim
  (section 6).
- `evidence relation`: what kind of structural relation links evidence to the
  interval (section 6).
- `alignment status`: trustworthiness of host/device timestamp mapping
  (section 7).
- MUST / MUST NOT / REQUIRED / MAY have RFC 2119 meaning.

## 3. Timeline Model

### 3.1 interval_kind

Every interval carries exactly one `interval_kind`:

- `productive_active`: covered by the productive timeline.
- `visible_productive_idle`: a gap (see below).

`interval_kind` and the idle explanation (section 5) are **separate fields**.
A gap is never classified as `productive_active`; `productive_active` never
receives an explanation category.

### 3.2 analysis span

- MUST be recorded per run, with one `analysis_status` value from the frozen
  enum (section 2).
- Default as defined in section 2; MUST report span boundaries in output
  metadata.
- If no productive task exists: with no explicit analysis span, emit
  `analysis_status = no_productive_span` and no device intervals; with an
  explicit analysis span, the entire span is one `visible_productive_idle`
  gap and is explained under the normal rules.
- Gaps before the first productive task or after the last productive task
  (boundary edges of the span) MUST be reported as `visible_productive_idle`
  only if inside the analysis span; otherwise they are out of scope and MUST
  NOT be invented.

### 3.3 Half-open interval algebra

- All intervals are half-open `[start_ns, end_ns)`, integer nanoseconds.
- MUST NOT emit zero-length or negative-length intervals.
- Explanation slices MUST NOT overlap each other.
- The union of explanation slices MUST equal the original gap.
- The productive union plus gap union MUST cover the analysis span exactly at
  integer-nanosecond precision. Rounding tolerance applies only to derived
  human-readable microsecond summaries.
- Overlapping tasks on the same stream: represent as a deterministic mutually
  exclusive partition using the `ambiguous_overlap` state:

```text
A [100,180)
B [150,220)
  -> A-only            [100,150)
  -> ambiguous_overlap [150,180)
  -> B-only            [180,220)
```

  Preserve links to both source events A and B. Each stream's state timeline
  remains a mutually exclusive partition.

## 4. Semantic Task Taxonomy

The existing `default_signal_classification_rules.tsv` describes structural
roles (`anchor` / `ignore`). It is a different dimension and MUST NOT be
reused as the productive taxonomy: `ignore` means "not a structural anchor",
not "non-productive" (e.g., `AI_CORE`, `EVENT_WAIT`, `MEMCPY`, `CAPTURE_WAIT`,
`SDMA` are all `ignore` in the current rules).

A separate ruleset is REQUIRED:

```text
idle_evidence_semantic_rules.tsv
```

with roles at least:

```text
productive_compute
productive_comm
productive_data_move
visible_wait
capture_control
record
runtime_control
unknown
```

M0 initial mapping (refinable in the TSV, per-direction detail allowed):

| task_type | role |
| --- | --- |
| `MEMCPY`, `MEMCPY_ASYNC`, `SDMA` | `productive_data_move` |
| `MEM_WRITE_VALUE`, `WRITE_VALUE` | `runtime_control` |
| `EVENT_WAIT`, `NOTIFY_WAIT` | `visible_wait` |
| `CAPTURE_WAIT`, `CAPTURE_RECORD` | `capture_control` |

- `productive_compute` / `productive_comm` MUST be determined by blob/label
  rules in the same TSV (kernel names, HCCL/NCCL patterns).
- Every run MUST output `semantic_rules_version`,
  `semantic_rules_sha256`, and per-event `matched_rule_id`.
- `productive_data_move` classification MUST keep direction/API granularity
  available (H2D/D2D/D2H and sync/async variants may differ semantically);
  the contract fixes the role, not a single unconditional mapping.
- The roles `record` and `unknown` are NOT explanation categories themselves;
  their mapping into explanations is defined in section 5.

## 5. Idle Explanation Categories

Each gap is sliced into explanation intervals. Categories:

| Category | Meaning | Evidence requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blocked_by_visible_wait` | Gap sub-interval is covered by a profiler-visible wait task (`EVENT_WAIT`, `NOTIFY_WAIT`, sync-family tasks). | device_event_coverage (section 6) |
| `capture_control_present` | Gap sub-interval is covered by capture/control tasks (`CAPTURE_WAIT`, `CAPTURE_RECORD`). | device_event_coverage |
| `runtime_control_present` | Gap sub-interval is covered by visible record or runtime-control tasks that are neither productive, wait, nor capture-control tasks. Applies to roles `record` and `runtime_control`. | device_event_coverage |
| `queued_visible_task_delay` | An enqueue host API is linked to a later visible device task via a unique exact `connectionId`, and a robustly positive delay interval exists between mapped API end and task start. | exact_connection_id (correlated only); section 7.3 |
| `host_sync_api_present` | An allowlisted host synchronization API whose mapped interval robustly overlaps the gap after calibrated clock mapping. Presence does not establish causality; a unique exact `connectionId` may be an additional supporting relation but MUST NOT replace robust overlap. | temporal_overlap (correlated only); exact_connection_id supporting only |
| `no_observed_device_work` | All streams in the stream universe are `empty_observed` over the sub-interval, and collection completeness is attested. | complete_absence_observation (direct) |
| `unattributed_visible_idle` | Everything else: insufficient evidence, profiler blind spots, unexposed queued work, host-side computation, sampling gaps. | none (by definition) |

Rules:

- `unattributed_visible_idle` MUST NOT be auto-attributed by any heuristic,
  pattern inference, or aggregation. A future rule must pass a controlled
  intervention validation before entering this contract (section 13).
- **`unknown`-role tasks**: a visible task classified `unknown` prevents
  `complete_absence_observation` but does not receive a semantic
  explanation. The covered interval remains `unattributed_visible_idle`,
  with the unknown task preserved as supporting diagnostic evidence. An
  `unknown` task MUST NOT be folded into `runtime_control_present`.
- `no_observed_device_work` is usable ONLY when ALL of the following hold:
  `collection_status == complete`; all discovered device shards were
  imported; all required task-bearing tables were readable; no dropped-event
  or truncated-capture condition was reported; `observed_universe_scan_complete`
  is true (every stream in the declared observed universe was scanned). In
  every other case (`incomplete` / `unknown` / `invalid`) the empty sub-
  interval MUST be classified as `unattributed_visible_idle`.
- `no_observed_device_work` means "no profiler-visible device work was
  observed", never "the device was idle" (section 12).
- A wait task covering an interval does not by itself justify "the gap was
  caused by this wait"; the safe statement is "the interval is covered by a
  visible wait task".
- An `exact_connection_id` link does not remove the alignment requirement:
  projecting host intervals onto device gaps across clock domains still
  requires calibrated mapping. Without calibration, the link MAY be
  displayed but cross-domain time coverage MUST NOT be computed.
- The host API allowlist (`host_sync` and `enqueue` families) lives in a
  versioned, hashed ruleset `idle_evidence_host_api_rules.tsv` (fields:
  `api_pattern`, `family` in {`host_sync`, `enqueue`}, `note`), analogous to
  the device semantic rules. Its `host_api_rules_version` and
  `host_api_rules_sha256` MUST be reported per run. Categories that depend on
  the allowlist MUST NOT be enabled without it.

## 6. Evidence Levels and Relations

### 6.1 Evidence levels

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `direct` | The category claim is established entirely from device-clock-domain observations: device-event coverage, or verified absence over the declared observed stream universe. A connectionId join alone is not direct evidence. |
| `correlated` | Temporal or structural association without a dependency edge. |
| `inferred` | Derived from neighborhood, repetition, or pattern context. Candidate-only in M0 (section 6.5). |
| `none` | No evidence supports any category. |

### 6.2 Evidence relations and level mapping

| Relation | Meaning | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `device_event_coverage` | A device-side task row covers the interval. | direct |
| `complete_absence_observation` | Verified absence of any task over the interval across a covered, completeness-attested stream universe. | direct |
| `exact_connection_id` | Profiler-provided `connectionId` join between host API and device task. | correlated |
| `temporal_overlap` | Time overlap between host API and gap (window rules in section 7). | correlated |
| `pattern_context` | Same-thread neighborhood, repeated-body context, or other pattern evidence. | inferred |
| `none` | No relation. | none |

### 6.3 Allowed combinations (normative matrix)

| Explanation category | Allowed level | Required relation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blocked_by_visible_wait` | direct | device_event_coverage |
| `capture_control_present` | direct | device_event_coverage |
| `runtime_control_present` | direct | device_event_coverage |
| `queued_visible_task_delay` | correlated | exact_connection_id |
| `host_sync_api_present` | correlated | temporal_overlap (robust); exact_connection_id supporting only |
| `no_observed_device_work` | direct | complete_absence_observation |
| `unattributed_visible_idle` | none | none |

Combinations outside this matrix MUST NOT be emitted. For
`host_sync_api_present`, an `exact_connection_id` link to a nearby task is
supporting evidence only: the API itself must robustly overlap the gap after
calibrated mapping, otherwise the category MUST NOT be emitted.

### 6.4 Join scope and link status

- The initial lookup key is `(run_id, db_idx, raw_connection_id)`; constrain
  further with `device_id`, `context_id`, process/thread identity, and time
  ordering when available.
- `link_status`: `unique` | `one_to_many` | `ambiguous` | `unresolved`.
- Only `unique` (or an explicitly allowed same-device one-to-many relation)
  MAY serve as `exact_connection_id` evidence.
- If one connection ID maps to multiple devices and the host record carries
  insufficient device/context information, the relation is `ambiguous` and
  MUST NOT produce `queued_visible_task_delay` or
  `host_sync_api_present` via `exact_connection_id`.
- Host API device attribution: API carries its own device id -> use it;
  unique connection join -> inherit the target task's device; otherwise
  `device_id = unknown` and the API MUST NOT be used for per-device
  explanations. A host API MUST NOT be attached to all devices merely
  because it temporally overlaps them.

### 6.5 Candidate-only evidence (M0)

A candidate is a diagnostic-only hypothesis or below-threshold association
that does not enter the official explanation partition. M0 candidate sources:

- pattern inference (`inferred` / `pattern_context`);
- possible-overlap host sync candidates (section 7.3);
- non-robust enqueue-to-task delay candidates (section 7.3).

Candidates:

- MUST NOT enter `traceloom_idle_explanation`.
- MUST NOT replace `unattributed_visible_idle`.
- MUST NOT contribute to `S_direct`, `S_correlated`, or `C_explained`
  (section 11).
- MAY be counted separately as diagnostic candidate coverage.
- A candidate with `candidate_level = correlated` is NOT an official
  correlated explanation; entry into the official partition is decided by
  robust gating (section 7.3).

### 6.6 Communication canonicalization

A canonical `TASK`-to-`COMMUNICATION_OP` match REQUIRES, in order:

1. compatible run/db scope;
2. compatible device identity;
3. an unambiguous exact `connectionId` when available;
4. temporally compatible intervals;
5. compatible communication metadata when available.

Degradation rules:

- exact `connectionId` + compatible device -> strongest canonicalization
  match.
- no `connectionId`, but compatible device + strong temporal and metadata
  match -> heuristic duplicate candidate only; MUST NOT be silently
  canonicalized in M0.

Other rules:

- `COMMUNICATION_OP` is the canonical productive communication interval;
  linked `TASK` rows are supporting evidence only.
- A communication `TASK` becomes a canonical productive interval only when no
  matching `COMMUNICATION_OP` exists.
- Canonicalization MUST preserve links to all source rows.
- The same source operation MUST NOT materialize multiple productive
  intervals solely because it appears in multiple profiler tables.
- When duplication cannot be determined, do NOT silently merge; emit an
  ambiguity diagnostic.

### 6.7 Uncertainty reporting

- Distribution summaries (`p50`, `p95`, `max`) and statistical uncertainty
  (bootstrap 95% CI) are different things and MUST be named differently:

```text
mean_wait_us, p50_wait_us, p95_wait_us
mean_wait_us_ci95_low, mean_wait_us_ci95_high
```

### 6.8 Mapping to existing vocabularies

| This contract | TraceLoom RFC v2 | Parent repo (RLCP) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `direct` | `confirmed` | device-layer localization evidence; still `localization`, never `causal` by itself |
| `correlated` | `contextual` | same |
| `inferred` | `heuristic` | candidate-only in M0; never enters localization output |
| (n/a) | (n/a) | `causal` requires a matched control/intervention (offline-intervention-gate semantics) |
| (n/a) | (n/a) | experiment evidence labels (`real-online`, `existing-server-probe`, `replay`, `simulation/model`, `projected-profile`, `derived-artifact`) classify the experiment; orthogonal to per-interval evidence level |

Every experiment producing idle evidence MUST carry a parent-repo evidence
label, and every interval claim MUST carry a per-interval evidence level.

## 7. Clock Domains and Alignment

### 7.1 Reference-point affine model

Host and device timestamps come from different clock domains. The mapping
function is:

```text
f(h) = d_ref + a * (h - h_ref)
```

with observation model:

```text
d_i = f(h_i) + epsilon_i
```

- `h_ref`: reference host timestamp (ns).
- `d_ref`: corresponding reference device timestamp (ns).
- `a`: clock scale; `drift_ppm = (a - 1) * 1e6`.
- `offset_ns` is DEFINED as `d_ref - h_ref` (the offset at the reference
  origin), not an arbitrary affine intercept.
- `epsilon_i`: per-marker absolute residual; not part of the mapping
  function.

Output fields: `host_to_device_scale`, `host_to_device_offset_ns` (= `d_ref
- h_ref`), `reference_host_ns`, `reference_device_ns`, `drift_ppm`,
`fit_marker_count`, `validation_marker_count`, `absolute_residual_p50_ns`,
`absolute_residual_p95_ns`, `absolute_residual_max_ns`.

### 7.2 Marker protocol and frozen fit

- Marker payload (frozen):

```text
marker_id
host_before_ns
host_after_ns
device_timestamp_ns
host_pid
host_tid
device_id
stream_id (if available)
connection_id (if available)
call_site
return_status
```

- Marker host time (frozen): `h_i = host_before_ns +
  (host_after_ns - host_before_ns) / 2` computed as integer floor division
  (overflow-safe midpoint form). `host_before_ns` / `host_after_ns` bracket
  the device-visible event and define marker bracket uncertainty.
- Fit / holdout split (frozen): sort markers by `h_i`; every fifth marker
  goes to the holdout set; the remaining markers form the fit set; the first
  and last markers MUST remain in the fit set. Fitting and reporting the
  final error on the same markers is forbidden (optimistic error estimates).
  A calibration REQUIRES at least 6 markers and a non-empty validation set;
  otherwise `alignment_status` MUST be `invalid` and no calibrated
  cross-clock explanation may be emitted. Run at least 3 repeated captures;
  report per-capture and pooled distributions.
- Frozen fit formulas:

```text
s_ij = (d_j - d_i) / (h_j - h_i),  h_j != h_i
a    = median{ s_ij }
h_ref = median{ h_i }
d_ref = median{ d_i - a*(h_i - h_ref) }
f(h) = d_ref + a * (h - h_ref)
```

  Median rule (frozen): for an even number of ordered values, the median is
  the arithmetic mean of the two central values.
- Outlier rejection MAY be applied after the initial fit, with rejected
  markers counted and reported; it MUST NOT be applied before the initial
  fit.
- Fit metadata REQUIRED: `fit_method` (= `theil_sen_median`), `fit_method_version`,
  `fit_random_seed` (fixed value `0`; deterministic), `input_marker_count`,
  `inlier_marker_count`, `rejected_marker_count`.
- Determinism statement: the fit procedure is deterministic under the
  numerical and median rules defined here. Implementations MUST match
  golden-fixture tolerances; bit-identical output across languages and float
  implementations is NOT claimed.
- `scale` serialization is fixed: decimal with 12 fractional digits (the
  scale is a ns/ns ratio; ppm-level drift needs ~6 digits, 12 leaves
  headroom). Mapped timestamps `f(h)` MUST be rounded to integer nanoseconds
  with round-half-to-even before any overlap or delay comparison, and golden
  fixtures MUST use the same rounding.

### 7.3 Overlap and delay windows

All uncertainties in device-clock domain.

```text
validation_p95_residual = p95 over holdout markers of
                          abs(device_timestamp_ns - f(h_i))
bracket_uncertainty_device_ns = abs(a) * p95((host_after_ns - host_before_ns)/2)
epsilon = validation_p95_residual + bracket_uncertainty_device_ns
```

**Host-sync overlap** (for `host_sync_api_present`), host interval
`[hs, he)` mapped to `[f(hs), f(he))`:

- **Possible overlap** (candidate discovery only):
  `[f(hs) - epsilon, f(he) + epsilon)` intersects the gap. Possible overlap
  MUST NOT produce a `traceloom_idle_explanation` row; the official
  explanation remains `unattributed_visible_idle`; it MAY produce a
  candidate-only diagnostic row; it MUST NOT contribute to attributable
  coverage.
- **Robust overlap**:
  `[f(hs) + epsilon, f(he) - epsilon)` intersects the gap. Only robust
  overlap MAY produce `host_sync_api_present` (`correlated`,
  `temporal_overlap`), and the emitted explanation slice MUST be the
  intersection of the robust interval and the remaining gap: a one-nanosecond
  intersection must not classify the whole gap.
- If the robust interval is empty (`host interval < 2*epsilon`), the host
  event is candidate-only and MUST NOT produce a correlated explanation.
  Short host events are inherently unrecognizable at this alignment quality;
  this is a documented cost, not a gap to paper over.

**Enqueue-to-task delay** (for `queued_visible_task_delay`; not an
interval-overlap question). For an enqueue API with end `he` linked to a
device task with start `ts` by exact `connectionId`:

```text
possible_delay = [f(he) - epsilon, ts)
robust_delay   = [f(he) + epsilon, ts)
```

`queued_visible_task_delay` MAY be emitted only when ALL hold:

1. the link is unique and exact (`link_status == unique`);
2. the API belongs to the enqueue family defined by the versioned, hashed
   host-API allowlist ruleset `idle_evidence_host_api_rules.tsv` (initial
   entries: `aclrtLaunchKernel*`, `aclrtMemcpyAsync*`);
3. `robust_delay` is non-empty (`ts > f(he) + epsilon`);
4. the emitted explanation is the intersection of `robust_delay` and the
   gap.

Otherwise the delay evidence is candidate-only (`candidate_status =
non_robust_delay`) and MUST NOT cover residual.

### 7.4 alignment_status

```text
alignment_status:
  not_required      # device-only evidence, no cross-domain comparison
  calibrated        # real marker data available
  synthetic_only    # validated on synthetic clock fixtures only
  uncalibrated      # no marker data
  invalid           # marker fit failed or contract violated
```

Behavior when `uncalibrated`:

- Host API rows MAY be imported and displayed.
- Time-overlap-based idle explanations MUST NOT be generated.
- API-to-task delay MUST NOT be computed.
- Synthetic clock fixtures prove the algorithm implementation, not real-trace
  calibration; `synthetic_only` MUST NOT be reported as `calibrated`.
- `synthetic_only` MAY support correlation-mechanism validation on controlled
  synthetic fixtures (their clock model and epsilon are known by
  construction), but MUST NOT support any real-trace cross-clock claim;
  correlation rows from synthetic fixtures are mechanism evidence only.

### 7.5 Deliverable set under the current environment constraint

With no marker-capable environment (`uncalibrated`) and no collection
attestation (`collection_status = unknown`), the M0 deliverable set on real
profiler fixtures is:

```text
blocked_by_visible_wait
capture_control_present
runtime_control_present
unattributed_visible_idle
```

`host_sync_api_present`, `queued_visible_task_delay`, and
`no_observed_device_work` are frozen in this contract but not enabled until
calibration data and collection attestation exist. On controlled synthetic
fixtures (`collection_status = complete` by construction, `synthetic_only`
alignment), `no_observed_device_work` is additionally available. Correlation
rules are delivered in frozen form and validated only on synthetic fixtures,
consistent with the parent-repo instruction to proceed immediately on fixed
fixtures.

## 8. Attribution Algorithm and Priority

1. Classify every task via `idle_evidence_semantic_rules.tsv`.
2. Canonicalize communication intervals (section 6.6).
3. Build the per-device productive timeline (union of canonical productive
   tasks).
4. Extract gaps within the analysis span (section 3.2 covers the no-
   productive-task case).
5. Build per-stream observable state timelines over the stream universe,
   with `ambiguous_overlap` partitioning (section 3.3).
6. Import host API events and resolve `connectionId` links
   (`link_status`, section 6.4) with alignment gating (section 7).
7. Slice each gap into explanation intervals with a deterministic priority:
   `blocked_by_visible_wait` > `capture_control_present` >
   `runtime_control_present` > `queued_visible_task_delay` >
   `host_sync_api_present` > `no_observed_device_work` >
   `unattributed_visible_idle`.
8. Aggregate explanation intervals to anchors, loop-tree nodes, device
   summaries, and SQL views.

Category priority is contract semantics; it MUST NOT be scanned as a tuning
hyperparameter.

## 9. Output Schema

Frozen interval conventions apply to interval-bearing tables
(`traceloom_device_interval`, `traceloom_stream_state`,
`traceloom_idle_explanation`): `[start_ns, end_ns)` half-open, integer
nanoseconds, `end_ns > start_ns`, `clock_domain` column, and the version
columns `contract_version`, `semantic_rules_version`,
`attribution_rule_version` (distinct: contract revision, taxonomy revision,
algorithm revision), and `run_id`.

Non-interval tables (`traceloom_clock_model`, which has two clock domains and
no interval of its own) are exempt from interval columns.
`traceloom_evidence_link` overlap fields are nullable: relations without a
temporal extent (`pattern_context`, `none`) carry null `overlap_start_ns` /
`overlap_end_ns`.

`run_id` MUST be `lowercase_hex(SHA-256(JCS(metadata_without_run_id)))`:
the `run_metadata.json` file canonicalized with RFC 8785 JSON
Canonicalization Scheme (JCS), with the `run_id` field excluded before
hashing, to avoid circular definition.

Tables (engineering implements these; semantics here take precedence over the
RFC where they differ):

- `traceloom_device_interval` — `interval_kind`: `productive_active` |
  `visible_productive_idle` (`analysis_status` lives in
  `traceloom_run_metadata`).
- `traceloom_stream_state` — observable per-stream states with
  `stream_universe_kind`, `stream_universe_size`, `observed_stream_count`,
  `observed_universe_scan_complete`, `collection_status`.
- `traceloom_host_api_event` — normalized host API rows.
- `traceloom_task_api_link` — `connectionId` joins with `link_status`.
- `traceloom_idle_explanation` — category, evidence level, alignment status,
  reason, source links.
- `traceloom_idle_candidate` (diagnostic; new):

```

  `traceloom_run_metadata` carries the required `analysis_status` even when
  no device-interval rows exist (e.g. `no_productive_span`, `empty_input`,
  `invalid_input`).

Engineering note: the current `NativeIr` has no `host_api_events`,
`clock_models`, `task_api_links`, `device_intervals`, `stream_states`, or
`idle_explanations`; and the existing `CANN_API` reading serves ACLGraph
capture/replay metadata, not general host-API event import. A dedicated
import path is REQUIRED (tool-repo issue #3).

## 10. Golden Fixtures

Each fixture is a synthetic msprof-schema SQLite database plus
`ground_truth.json`. Every ground-truth interval MUST carry:

```json
{
  "start_ns": 100,
  "end_ns": 200,
  "interval_kind": "visible_productive_idle",
  "explanation_category": "blocked_by_visible_wait",
  "evidence_level": "direct",
  "evidence_relation": "device_event_coverage",
  "alignment_status": "not_required",
  "collection_status": "complete",
  "expected_source_keys": ["TASK:17"]
}
```

Tests MUST assert at least: exact interval boundaries; category; evidence
level; relation; lineage (`expected_source_keys`); explanation slices
non-overlapping; explanation union equals the original gap; productive union
plus gap union covers the analysis span exactly at integer-nanosecond
precision.

Fixture classes:

| Class | Construction | Validates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `positive` | Known wait injected (wait task coverage, host sync overlap, clean multi-stream) | correct attribution, category priority |
| `adjacent_overlap` | Event boundaries overlapping/nested across streams; ambiguous edges | interval algebra, `ambiguous_overlap` partition, no double counting |
| `event_loss` | Subset of events deleted (wait task, host API, stream rows) | residual preservation, no false attribution from absence, `collection_status` downgrade |
| `clock_drift` | Timestamp transforms (offset, linear drift, jitter) | alignment-error reporting, robust-overlap and robust-delay rules, no drift-induced false `correlated` |

Edge cases REQUIRED in the fixture set: duplicate event rows; invalid / zero /
negative durations; cross-device identical `connectionId` (expect
`link_status = ambiguous`); the same communication represented in both
`TASK` and `COMMUNICATION_OP` (canonicalization, no duplicate productive
intervals); `unknown`-role tasks inside gaps (remain `unattributed_visible_idle`,
diagnostic evidence preserved); analysis-span boundary gaps; no productive
task at all (`no_productive_span` and full-span-gap behaviors); gaps shorter
than the alignment error; same-stream overlapping tasks; monolithic vs split
profile equivalence.

A single canonical generator for the four classes is allowed, but MUST NOT
limit all tests to one scenario: distinct schema boundaries require
independent fixtures. Every fixture ships `run_metadata.json` (parent commit,
fixture class, injected perturbation, ground-truth reference, evidence label;
`simulation/model` for synthetic).

Checked-in fixture and CI check: the counterexample "host wait exists but
visible idle is zero" (a host sync API event present in the capture while the
device productive timeline covers the whole analysis span) is a REQUIRED
executable check. It lives in the engineering repository at
`native/tests/fixtures/idle_evidence/host_wait_zero_visible_idle/` (synthetic
msprof-schema SQLite database + `ground_truth.json` + `run_metadata.json`,
fixture class `positive`) and is verified by
`traceloom_native_idle_evidence_golden_fixture_tests`, which runs in CI
(`.github/workflows/native-deb.yml`, job `idle-evidence-golden-check`). The
check asserts BOTH sides of the counterexample: the fixture's host-side sync
API row exists (host wait), and the analyzer reports zero
`visible_productive_idle` over the same fixture (device timeline fully
productive). Fixture results are contract/example evidence and MUST NOT be
presented as a matched A/B of runtime traces.

## 11. Evaluation Metrics

### 11.1 Coverage (mutually exclusive shares)

```text
S_direct     = T_direct     / T_all-gap
S_correlated = T_correlated / T_all-gap
S_residual   = T_residual   / T_all-gap
S_direct + S_correlated + S_residual = 1
C_explained = S_direct + S_correlated
```

In M0 there are no official `inferred` explanations, so these three shares
exhaust the gap time. The stacked bar is `direct | correlated | residual`.
Per-category coverage (each explanation category's share of `T_all-gap`)
MUST also be reported for hotspot analysis.

When `T_all-gap == 0` (fully productive span, or no valid span), the three
shares and `C_explained` are `NA` (not 0, and not silently omitted); pooled
aggregates MUST exclude NA rows and MUST report the number of NA runs.

### 11.2 False attribution

```text
FAR = T_wrongly_attributed / T_attributed
```

`T_attributed = T_direct + T_correlated`. If `T_attributed == 0`,
`FAR = NA`, not 0.

`T_wrongly_attributed` includes any emitted non-residual duration for which
at least one of:

1. the emitted category differs from the ground-truth category; or
2. the emitted explanation extends beyond the ground-truth interval for that
   category (e.g., ground truth `[100,150) blocked_by_visible_wait`, output
   `[100,170)` -> `[150,170)` is wrongly attributed); or
3. the emitted evidence level/relation is stronger than allowed by ground
   truth.

Additionally report separately, so FAR does not hide the category-vs-boundary
distinction:

```text
category_confusion_matrix
boundary_over_attribution_ns
boundary_under_attribution_ns
```

### 11.3 Collection overhead

Matched trace/no-trace runs; report p50/p95 delta of end-to-end latency and
throughput. Without a runnable environment, freeze the definition and report
format; the axis stays empty in the figure.

### 11.4 Curves

The main figure reports `C_explained` and `FAR` over a scan of tunable knobs,
not a single operating point. Scan: `correlation tolerance` (epsilon
multiplier), `minimum evidence threshold`, `marker density`,
`instrumentation level` (the last two require a runnable environment; leave
empty until then). NEVER scan category priority. Never report coverage
without its FAR curve.

## 12. Forbidden Claims

- This contract NEVER produces "true hardware idle". No profiler observation
  proves hardware idleness without an independent hardware occupancy counter,
  full scheduler state, or controlled intervention. The strongest permissible
  statement is: "no profiler-visible device work was observed".
- "idle" without a qualifier (`visible_productive_idle`,
  `no_observed_device_work`, or the specific category) is forbidden.
- Empty intervals MUST NOT be labeled `no_observed_device_work` unless
  `collection_status == complete` and the observed universe was fully
  scanned; otherwise they are `unattributed_visible_idle`.
- Intervals covered by `unknown`-role tasks MUST NOT be labeled
  `runtime_control_present` or `no_observed_device_work`; they remain
  `unattributed_visible_idle`.
- "the gap was caused by this wait" — forbidden without direct dependency
  evidence; permissible: "the interval is covered by a visible wait task".
- "the host synchronized" as causality — host sync API presence is
  `correlated` unless a dependency edge exists.
- "coverage = X%" without the false-attribution curve.
- Any causal claim or performance-improvement claim from profiler/analysis
  output; this contract's evidence is conservative localization evidence.
- Proposed parent-repo `claim_ledger.md` wording:

> M0 produces conservative cross-layer localization evidence for
> profiler-visible productive gaps. It does not establish hardware idleness,
> dependency causality, or performance benefit.

## 13. Change Control

- This contract freezes once approved in the parent-repo issue #2.
- Category, level, relation, window-rule, alignment-status, and forbidden-
  wording changes MUST be decided in the parent issue before engineering
  implementation (per tool-repo issue #3 boundary).
- New residual-attribution rules require a controlled-intervention validation
  first.
- Promotion of candidate-only evidence into official explanations follows the
  same change-control path.

## 14. Deferred Questions

- Nonlinear drift: does the affine model need a piecewise or quadratic
  extension for very long captures, and at what duration?
- Upgrade path from `synthetic_only` to `calibrated`: minimum marker count,
  validation residual bound, and repeated-capture criteria.
- `queued_visible_task_delay` promotion: can same-thread/same-context
  evidence plus exact `connectionId` justify `direct` in future
  instrumentation? M0 keeps it `correlated`.
- `productive_data_move` per-direction mapping detail (H2D/D2D/D2H,
  sync/async) in the semantic rules TSV.
- Stream universe evolution: when can a workload-owned universe (vs observed
  universe) be established without runtime cooperation?
- One-to-many `link_status`: when is a same-device one-to-many relation
  explicitly allowed as exact evidence?
- Heuristic communication canonicalization (no `connectionId`): what
  thresholds make it safe to promote from candidate to canonical in a future
  version?
